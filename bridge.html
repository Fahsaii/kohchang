                <h3>RED BRIDGE</h3>
                <p>It is also known as the Baan Salak Phet Mangrove Forest Restoration Project.  It is a nature study route on a red wooden bridge that stretches to the end at the mouth of Salak Phet Bay, a distance of 520 meters.  We will see a variety of strange-looking plants that allow us to recognize that.  The mangrove forest is a rich source of food for many animals.  Some parts of the corridor will have trees leaning together like a tree tunnel.  Walk to the middle of the bridge to see the picture.  The red bridge contrasts with the green mangrove leaves alternating the horizon.</p>
